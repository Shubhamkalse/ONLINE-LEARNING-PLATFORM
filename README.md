This Online Learning Platform is a full-stack web application built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for database management. The platform offers a user-friendly interface, smooth animations, and real-time course management. Developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), it highlights my full-stack development and UI design skills.

Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js with Framer Motion and GSAP for animations
Backend: Node.js with Express.js for RESTful APIs
Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ORM
Development Tool: Visual Studio Code
